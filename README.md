# Customer Churn Project

This project utilizes a telecom dataset for exploratory data analysis and modeling of customer churn. It identifies top churn drivers and identifies customers who are high churn risk who haven't churned yet for intervention. All analysis and plotting is contained in the jupyter notebook with the results summarized in the included presentation slides.
